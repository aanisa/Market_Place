# The Market Place
For this challenge, you will be working to create an experience that is 'game-like'. Specifically, you will be creating an interface for users to 'buy' from a list of 12 items. The prices for each of the items will be displayed and as the user buys an item, money will be deducted from their account in exchange for one of those items. That item is kept in a player inventory. Additionally, every 15 seconds, the prices of those items will change. The player will also be allowed to 'sell' items from their inventory in exchange for the current price of the item. This will give the player to buy the items at one price, and then sell at another.

Every 15 seconds, the prices should change and with it the listed price on the DOM. Specifically, the market price of each of the items should fluctuate up or down (positive or negative) fifty cents (between 1 cent and 50 cents) with each fifteen-second interval.

Any given item is not allowed to go below a cost of 50 cents, or above the cost of 9 dollars and 99 cents.

The information displayed for each of the items should have a button-like functionality where the user can interact with each of the fruit displays.

Available to the user is a total cash and an inventory display that shows how much of each of the item they have purchased. Also on the user display, should be an average purchased price, which shows, on average, how much money they have spent on a given item in their inventory.

Meaning that by clicking on the display for each of the items, allows the user to buy one of the items, at market price, which will be deducted from the total cash. The user is not allowed to spend more than they have.

The user will start with $100.
